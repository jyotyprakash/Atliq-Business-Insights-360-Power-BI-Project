# BI360 Project Overview

üîç **The Challenge**  
Our initial task was to create dashboards comparing actuals with last year‚Äôs performance. However, we soon realized that the business‚Äôs primary interest was in evaluating whether their set targets were being met. This pivotal insight reshaped our approach, prompting us to revise and update the dashboards in alignment with the company's strategic objectives.

üí° **The Takeaway**  
This experience highlighted the importance of asking the right questions to drive insightful analysis. It also expanded my understanding of how business management teams approach decision-making and problem-solving.
