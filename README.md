# Atliq-Hardware-Power-BI-Project

🔍 𝐓𝐡𝐞 𝐂𝐡𝐚𝐥𝐥𝐞𝐧𝐠𝐞: 
Our initial task was to create dashboards comparing actuals with last year’s performance. However, we soon realized that the business’s primary interest was in evaluating whether their set targets were being met. This pivotal insight reshaped our approach, prompting us to revise and update the dashboards in alignment with the company's strategic objectives. 
 
💡 𝐓𝐡𝐞 𝐓𝐚𝐤𝐞𝐚𝐰𝐚𝐲: 
This experience highlighted the importance of asking the right questions to drive insightful analysis. It also expanded my understanding of how business management teams approach decision-making and problem-solving.
